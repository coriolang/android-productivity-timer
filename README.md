## About
It is a useful stopwatch application inspired by the famous Pomodoro technique! The main idea is to break one long work period into small intervals of work followed by short breaks. In this application, the user will be able to run a stopwatch and set an upper limit. After the limit is reached, the app will send the user a notification â€” a reminder to rest.
